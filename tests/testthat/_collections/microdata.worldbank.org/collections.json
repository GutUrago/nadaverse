Data sets and analysis from nationally representative surveys in 38 African countries are accessible free of charge.\r\nUsing a standard questionnaire that allows comparisons across countries and over time, the network's national partner organizations in 35+ African countries complete survey rounds (waves) every two to three years, each representing about 75% of the continent's population. Interviews are conducted face to face in the language of the respondent's choice.<\/p>\r\n<p>Afrobarometer's work is grounded in the belief that African societies thrive when African voices count in public policy and development. Core objectives are to produce scientifically reliable data and analysis on public opinion in Africa, to strengthen the capacity of African institutions for democratic governance survey research and analysis, and to broadly disseminate and apply democratic governance survey results to give the public a voice in policymaking.\r\nSurveys track indicators on a wide variety of standard topics, ranging from political and economic values and evaluations to tolerance, corruption, lived poverty, access to infrastructure and services, and security. Each round also includes special modules on pressing issues, such as climate change, gender equality, migration, China in Africa, and social media. Each national partner adds a set of timely country-specific questions in each survey round.\r\nBased on Afrobarometer's reputation as the leading source of public attitude data on Africa, its data are widely used in global indices and reports by government agencies, development partners, civil society, academics, and the news media. Its indicators also measure progress toward 12 of the 17 U.N. Sustainable Development Goals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contacts:\r\nFor general inquiries: admin@afrobarometer.org\r\nFor data: datarequests@afrobarometer.org\r\nFor management questions:\r\nbruno.v.dyk@afrobarometer.org (funding)\r\nsnkomo@afrobarometer.org (communications and partnerships)\r\nfelixbiga@afrobarometer.org (management)<\/p>"

The individual country datasets, aggregated datasets (across countries and years), panel datasets, and all relevant survey documentation are available to those who register (registration is free).\r\n\r\n<\/p><p>The Enterprise Survey is answered by business owners and top managers. Sometimes the survey respondent calls company accountants and human resource managers into the interview to answer questions in the sales and labor sections of the survey. Typically 1200-1800 interviews are conducted in larger economies, 360 interviews are conducted in medium-sized economies, and for smaller economies, 150 interviews take place.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The manufacturing and services sectors are the primary business sectors of interest. Formal (registered) companies with 5 or more employees are targeted for interview. Services firms include construction, retail, wholesale, hotels, restaurants, transport, storage, communications, and IT. For larger economies, specific manufacturing sub-sectors are selected as additional strata on the basis of employment, value-added, and total number of establishments figures.  Firms with 100% government/state ownership are not eligible to participate in an Enterprise Survey. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>In some countries, other surveys, which depart from the usual Enterprise Survey methodology, are conducted. Examples include 1) Informal Surveys- surveys of informal (unregistered) enterprises and 2) Micro Surveys- surveys fielded to registered firms with less than five employees. \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div>"

Results from the first survey were published in 2011 and have been followed by subsequent survey results from 2014 and in 2017. The 2021 edition, based on nationally representative surveys of about 128,000 adults in 123 economies during the COVID-19 pandemic, contains updated indicators on access to and use of formal and informal financial services, including on the use of cards, mobile phones, and the internet to make and receive digital payments—including the adoption of digital merchant and utility payments during the pandemic—and offers insights into the behaviors that enable financial resilience. The data also identify gaps in access to and usage of financial services by women and poor adults.<\/p><p>The survey results reflect a snapshot in time based on questions that respondents answer about their habits and experiences of the previous year. Comparing the current survey with results from the 2011, 2014, and 2017 editions reveal which trends endure, expand, and grow over extended periods of time. The report provides global averages as well as averages for high-income and developing economies. It also highlights findings for select economies to illustrate general patterns and interesting findings. Data for all economies for all figures are available on the Global Findex website.<\/p><p>The Global Findex Database has become a mainstay of global efforts to promote financial inclusion. In addition to being widely cited by policy makers, researchers, and development practitioners, Global Findex data are used to track progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.<\/p><p>The database, the full text of the report, and the underlying economy-level data for all figures—along with the questionnaire, the survey methodology, and other relevant materials— <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex\">are available here<\/a>.<\/p><p>All regional and global averages presented in this publication are adult population weighted.

Examples of service delivery surveys include Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) and Quantitative Service Delivery Surveys (QSDS). PETS are tools in a methodology used to track the follow of public resources (including human, financial, or in-kind) from the highest levels of government to frontline service providers. QSDS examines the efficacy of spending and the relationship between those who contract for a service and those who deliver it (for example, the relationship between parents and school administrators).
